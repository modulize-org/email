description: Introducing "Modulize: Email": A library of beautiful emails built using React Email and Tailwind CSS.

Hey there ðŸ‘‹! We are [Chris](https://twitter.com/itschrisjayden) & [Gui](https://twitter.com/0xqruz), and love to build full stack applications. But we noticed building emails for those apps felt like a massive chore and time sink.

And we want to spend time making apps, not emails. So we decided to build a library of emails that we could copy and paste into our projects.

<Callout className="mt-6"> The idea of copying and pasting components, much like this documentation, is heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui]( https://ui.shadcn.com/). A huge thank you to [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) for providing the inspiration and leading the way in the "copy and paste" movement. </Callout>

Despite what some may guess, this library is not distributed via npm and is not intended to restrict or limit your creativity. Instead, you have the freedom to choose the emails that fit your needs, copy their code directly into your project, and personalize them to meet your specific requirements.

Happy coding!
