## About

Hey there ðŸ‘‹! We are [Chris](https://twitter.com/itschrisjayden) & [Gui](https://twitter.com/0xqruz) and we created this project.


<Callout className="mt-6"> The idea of copying and pasting components, much like this documentation, is heavily inspired by [shadcn/ui]( https://ui.shadcn.com/). A huge thank you to [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) for providing the inspiration and leading the way in the "copy and paste" movement. </Callout>

## Credits

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - For the copy and paste idea and the documentation.
- [React Email](https://react.email) - For making it easy to create responsive emails with React.
